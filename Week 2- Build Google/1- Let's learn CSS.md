# CSS

CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a styling language used to describe the presentation and visual appearance of HTML documents. It provides a set of rules and properties that define how elements on a web page should be displayed, such as colors, fonts, layouts, and animations.

Here are some code examples to demonstrate the use of CSS:

1. Changing Font Color:
```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
```

2. Setting Background Color:
```css
body {
  background-color: #f1f1f1;
}
```

3. Applying Styling to a Class:
```css
.button {
  background-color: green;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
```

4. Adjusting Element Size and Position:
```css
#header {
  width: 100%;
  height: 80px;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}
```

5. Creating a Responsive Layout:
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

These examples demonstrate just a few of the many possibilities with CSS. CSS allows developers to control the visual aspects of a website, making it an essential tool for creating attractive and engaging web pages.
