# Proper document structure

In HTML, the structure of a webpage is defined using a hierarchical structure of HTML elements. The basic structure of an HTML document consists of an opening `<html>` tag, followed by a `<head>` section and a `<body>` section. Here's an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Heading 1</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Let's break down the structure:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration specifies the HTML version being used, which is HTML5 in this case.

- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML document. It encloses the entire document.

- `<head>`: The head section contains metadata about the webpage, such as the page title, linked stylesheets, scripts, and other information that is not displayed on the page.

- `<title>`: This element specifies the title of the webpage, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

- `<body>`: The body section contains the visible content of the webpage, including headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other elements.

- `<h1>`: A heading element that represents the main heading of the page.

- `<p>`: A paragraph element used to define paragraphs of text.

These are just a few examples of HTML elements that can be used to structure a webpage. HTML provides a wide range of elements to represent different types of content and organize it in a logical structure. By combining these elements, you can create well-structured and semantically meaningful webpages.
