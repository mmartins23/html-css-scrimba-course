# Spans

In HTML, the `<span>` element is an inline-level element that is used to apply styling or add semantic meaning to a specific section of text within a larger block of content. It is often used as a container for a small section of text or a specific part of a sentence.

Here's an example of using the `<span>` element in HTML:

```html
<p>
  Welcome to our website! <span class="highlight">Join</span> our mailing list
  for the latest updates.
</p>
```

In this example, the word "Join" is wrapped in a `<span>` element with the class name "highlight". The `<span>` element allows us to target and style that specific word differently from the rest of the text.

In CSS, you can use the `<span>` element as a selector to apply styles to the enclosed text or target it for specific interactions. Here's an example of applying CSS styles to the `<span>` element:

```css
.highlight {
  color: blue;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

In this CSS example, the `.highlight` class is applied to the `<span>` element, and it defines styles to make the enclosed text appear in blue color and with bold font weight.

You can use the `<span>` element in various ways in combination with CSS to achieve specific styling or functional effects. It provides a way to target and manipulate specific parts of text within a larger HTML structure.
