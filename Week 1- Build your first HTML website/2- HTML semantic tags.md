# HTML Semantic Tags

HTML semantic tags are special tags introduced in HTML5 that provide more meaningful and descriptive elements for structuring web content. These tags convey the purpose and role of different sections of a webpage, making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to understand and interpret the content. Here are some commonly used HTML semantic tags with code examples:

1. `<header>`: This tag represents the introductory or top section of a webpage. It typically contains the site logo, navigation, or a heading. Example:
   ```html
   <header>
     <h1>My Website</h1>
     <nav>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
         <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
         <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
       </ul>
     </nav>
   </header>
   ```

2. `<nav>`: This tag is used to define a section of navigation links within a webpage. It usually contains links to different pages or sections of the website. Example:
   ```html
   <nav>
     <ul>
       <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
       <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
       <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
     </ul>
   </nav>
   ```

3. `<main>`: This tag represents the main content area of a webpage. It should contain the central focus of the page's content, excluding header, footer, and navigation. Example:
   ```html
   <main>
     <h2>About Us</h2>
     <p>Welcome to our website. We are a company that...</p>
   </main>
   ```

4. `<article>`: This tag is used to define a self-contained, independent piece of content within a webpage. It could represent a blog post, news article, or forum post. Example:
   ```html
   <article>
     <h3>Blog Post Title</h3>
     <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit...</p>
   </article>
   ```

5. `<section>`: This tag defines a section or grouping of related content within a webpage. It helps in organizing content into logical blocks. Example:
   ```html
   <section>
     <h2>Services</h2>
     <p>We offer a range of services including...</p>
   </section>
   ```

6. `<footer>`: This tag represents the footer or bottom section of a webpage. It typically contains copyright information, contact details, or links to related pages. Example:
   ```html
   <footer>
     <p>&copy; 2023 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
     <nav>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="#">Privacy Policy</a></li>
         <li><a href="#">Terms of Service</a></li>
       </ul>
     </nav>
   </footer>
   ```

These semantic tags provide more structure and meaning to the content, enhancing accessibility, search engine optimization, and overall readability of webpages. It is recommended to use these tags appropriately to improve the semantic structure of your HTML documents.
