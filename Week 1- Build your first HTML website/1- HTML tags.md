# HTML Tags

HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of a web page. They provide a way to mark up different parts of the content to give them meaning and specify how they should be displayed in a web browser. Here are some commonly used HTML tags with code examples:

1. `<h1>` to `<h6>`: These tags represent different levels of headings. They are used to define headings and subheadings on a page. Example:
   ```html
   <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
   <h2>This is a Subheading</h2>
   ```

2. `<p>`: This tag is used to define a paragraph of text. Example:
   ```html
   <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
   ```

3. `<a>`: This tag is used to create a hyperlink. It is used with the `href` attribute to specify the URL to link to. Example:
   ```html
   <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
   ```

4. `<img>`: This tag is used to insert an image into a web page. It is used with the `src` attribute to specify the image URL. Example:
   ```html
   <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
   ```

5. `<ul>` and `<li>`: These tags are used to create an unordered list. The `<ul>` tag is used to define the list, and the `<li>` tag is used to define each list item. Example:
   ```html
   <ul>
     <li>Item 1</li>
     <li>Item 2</li>
     <li>Item 3</li>
   </ul>
   ```

6. `<div>`: This tag is used to group and style elements together. It is a container that helps in organizing the content on a page. Example:
   ```html
   <div>
     <p>This is some content.</p>
     <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
   </div>
   ```

These are just a few examples of HTML tags. There are many more tags available in HTML to structure and format different types of content on a web page.
