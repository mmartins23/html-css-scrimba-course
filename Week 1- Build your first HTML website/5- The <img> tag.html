      After a 115 days long journey, the crew of 12 finally arrived at their

Challenge:
Add a second image to our article. Find one via Google and place it
under the <h1> element but over the <h3> element. Remember to use
the width attribute to make the image as wide as the other elements.


Explanation
The purpose of using `width="100%"` in an `<img>` tag is to make the image span the full width of its container element. 

By setting the width to 100%, the image will automatically adjust its size to fill the available horizontal space within the container. This ensures that the image expands or contracts proportionally to fit the width of the container, regardless of the screen size or device used to view the webpage.

Using `width="100%"` is commonly used in responsive web design to create fluid and flexible layouts. It allows the image to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, providing a better user experience by ensuring the image is properly displayed on various devices.

It's worth noting that setting the width to 100% may affect the aspect ratio of the image if the height is not constrained or specified. To maintain the original aspect ratio, you can also set the height attribute to auto (`height="auto"`), which allows the image to scale proportionally based on the specified width.

Overall, the `width="100%"` attribute in an `<img>` tag helps in creating responsive and fluid images that adapt to different screen sizes and provide a visually pleasing layout.
