# Fix the image path

The `<img>` tag is used to display images on a web page. The `src` attribute specifies the image source, which can be a URL or a file path to the image file on the server or within the project directory. The `alt` attribute, short for alternative text, is used to provide a textual description of the image. Let's explore why it's important to add the `alt` attribute and provide examples:

1. Importance of the `alt` attribute:
   - Accessibility: The `alt` attribute is crucial for web accessibility. It helps visually impaired users who rely on screen readers understand the content of an image. Screen readers read out the alt text, enabling users who cannot see the image to understand its context and purpose.
   - Failed image loading: If an image fails to load for any reason, the alt text will be displayed in its place, ensuring that users still receive relevant information.
   - SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Search engines use alt text to understand and index images. Providing descriptive and accurate alt text can improve the accessibility and discoverability of your website's images in search engine results.

2. Examples of `src` and `alt` attributes in HTML:
   - External image with absolute URL:
     ```html
     <img src="https://example.com/image.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset over the ocean">
     ```

   - Internal image with relative file path:
     ```html
     <img src="images/image.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset over the ocean">
     ```

   - Image with no alt text (e.g., decorative image):
     ```html
     <img src="images/decorative.jpg" alt="">
     ```

   - Image with a brief note in the alt text (e.g., decorative image with additional context):
     ```html
     <img src="images/decorative.jpg" alt="Decorative image: Background illustration">
     ```

It's important to choose alt text that accurately describes the content or purpose of the image. If the image is purely decorative and does not convey any important information, you can use an empty alt attribute (`alt=""`) or include a brief note to indicate its decorative nature.

By incorporating the `alt` attribute, you enhance the accessibility of your website, improve user experience, and contribute to better SEO practices.
