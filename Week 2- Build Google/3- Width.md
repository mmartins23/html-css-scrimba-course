In CSS, the `width` property is used to set the width of an element. It determines how much horizontal space an element should occupy on the webpage. The `width` property can be specified in various units such as pixels, percentages, or relative units.

Here are a few code examples to illustrate the usage of the `width` property:

1. Setting width in pixels:
```css
div {
  width: 300px;
}
```
This example sets the width of the `div` element to be 300 pixels.

2. Setting width as a percentage:
```css
div {
  width: 50%;
}
```
This example sets the width of the `div` element to be 50% of its parent container's width.

3. Using relative units:
```css
div {
  width: 80vw;
}
```
This example sets the width of the `div` element to be 80% of the viewport width. The `vw` unit represents a percentage of the viewport width.

4. Auto width:
```css
div {
  width: auto;
}
```
This example allows the `div` element to adjust its width automatically based on its content or the available space.

The `width` property is commonly used to control the layout and responsiveness of elements in CSS. It provides flexibility in defining the width of elements to achieve desired visual effects and responsive designs on different devices and screen sizes.
